# ATM_INTERFACE
This project simulates an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface in Java. It allows users to interact with the system by performing operations such as checking the balance, withdrawing money, depositing funds, and transferring money between accounts. The ATM interface provides a simple text-based interaction for users to perform theseÂ operations.
